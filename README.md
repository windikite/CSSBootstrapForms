My 35th assignment! This assignment has us learn more about forms, styling and validating them. 

Assignment 1  
1. I first made a 2-column form that collapses on small devices.  
2. Second, I created an inline form that would have multiple inputs in a horizontal row.      
3. Lastly, I implemented a form that stacked the inputs as well as their labels, stretching across the form container.  

Assignment 2  
1. For this, I added form-control and added my own custom tweaks for colors to make it stand out and help with contrast. Then I ensured some simple validation by making sure there were appropriate feedback messages, the select had valid options, and the appropriate classes were added to forms and inputs.
